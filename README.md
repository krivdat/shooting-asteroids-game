# Shooting Asteroids Game

Little mini-game written in plain JavaScript, css and html.
You can play it [here](http://tomas.krivda.eu/asteroids/) or [here](https://krivdat.github.io/shooting-asteroids-game).

## Brief Description

Developed while improving my coding knowledge. The purpose is to shoot falling asteroids with weapon and prevent them hitting the Earth or the weapon. You can fire max three missiles at a time. After certain number of destroyed asteroids the level increases which means more asteroids and increased speed.

## Game Controls

Use either keyboard - arrows left and right to move weapon and space to shoot, or touch arrow and fire icons on touch devices.

## TODO list

[ ] Clean up and refactor code
[ ] Add TOP 10 scores list - first only with local storage for the same browser, later using remote database
[ ] Add different types of falling objects to destroy (not only asteroids), with different parameters (image, falling speed, horizontal movement,...)
[ ] Add other falling objects just as a distraction
[ ] Add different types of missiles e.g. after reaching certain level. They could be different size and speed.

## Credits

Inspiration for the game came after viewing YouTube tutorial [Build Flappy Bird and Doodle Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xPsg6yv7TU&t=2780s) by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) / their [GitHub profile](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp) - I highly recommend their channel.
